        <h2>About Our Initiative</h2>
        <p>Our initiative focuses on addressing the mental health challenges faced by informal workers in India. We believe that everyone deserves access to quality mental health support, regardless of their employment status.</p>
        <p>Informal workers, who make up a significant portion of India's workforce, often face unique stressors and barriers to accessing mental health care. Our goal is to raise awareness, advocate for policy changes, and develop targeted interventions to support this vulnerable population.</p>
        <h3>Our Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Increase awareness about mental health issues among informal workers</li>
            <li>Advocate for improved access to mental health services</li>
            <li>Develop community-based support programs</li>
            <li>Collaborate with policymakers to address systemic challenges</li>
        </ul>
